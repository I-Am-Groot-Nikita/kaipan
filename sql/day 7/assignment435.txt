select ceiling(4.8) as CeilValue;

Q-2 Write a query which will return value '4.0' for input value of '4.1' as well as '4.8'.
select floor(4.1) as CeilValue;
select floor(4.8) as CeilValue;

Q-3 What will be the output of following query:
	SELECT MOD(11,3); 
	SELECT 11 % 3;


Q-4 Write a query to find 2 raise to power 3.
select power(2,3) as power;

-   Tables Used:=
    
    -	student  (recid, name)

    -   studentdetail (recid, studentid, standard, flagsex)

    -   studentpresent (recid, studentid, month, present)

    -   studenthours (recid, studentid, datex, hours)

    -   product (recid, name)

    -   productprice (recid, productid, code, effdt, price)


	- Write a query to display all the product names with code in bracket in one column and 2 decimal significant price in second column, 
	e.g. : MySql book (MS09210) | 10.99
	Here 'MySql book' is product name and 'MS09210' is the product code while '10.99' is the 2 decimal significant price.

    select concat(p.name,"(",pp.code,")"), truncate(price,2) from product_trainee_35 p
    inner join productprice_trainee_35 pp on p.recid = pp.recid;



	
	- Write a query to display following information separated by comma in a single row for the students who have atleast one 'a' in their name. 
	The column heading should be STUDENTINFO.
	
	student name, standard, flag_sex

      select concat(s.name,",",sd.standard,",",sd.flagsex) "student name, standard, flag_sex"
   from student_trainee_35 s inner join studentdetail_trainee_35 sd on s.recid = sd.recid where s.name like '%a%' ;
